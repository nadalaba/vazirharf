Vazirharf is designed to split Lam-Alef ligatures into two distinct glyphs, 
enhancing compatibility with typing platforms where highlighting individual 
letters (harf) within a ligature is necessary—without sacrificing the visual 
integrity of the original design.

Modifications:
- All Lam-Alef combinations (e.g. لا، لآ، لأ، لإ، لٱ، ڵا...) now use two separate glyphs 
  instead of one.
- These combinations are handled through contextual alternates rather than static 
  ligature glyphs.
- Lam-Alef lookups previously defined under `'liga'` and `'rlig'` have been removed.
  The new behavior is implemented via `'rclt'` (Required Contextual Alternates).

The first version of Vazirmatn (formerly named Vazir) was based on DejaVu 2.35 
(was committed to the public domain) to begin designing and developing this new
typeface. Non-Arabic (Latin) glyphs and data in the full version are imported 
from Roboto Variable font (version v3.004) under the Apache License, 
Version 2.0. https://github.com/davelab6/Roboto-Classic
