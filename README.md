# Vazirharf Font فونت وزیرحرف

Vazirharf is a minimal fork of the original [Vazirmatn](https://github.com/rastikerdar/vazirmatn) font, created by the late Saber Rastikerdar.
It is designed to split Lam-Alef ligatures into two distinct glyphs, enhancing compatibility with typing platforms like [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com), where highlighting individual letters (**harf**) within a ligature is essential —without compromising the visual integrity of the original design.

## What’s New in Version 34.000

- **Lam-Alef Redesign**: All Lam-Alef combinations (e.g. لا، لآ، لأ، لإ، لٱ، ڵا...) now use two separate glyphs instead of one.
- **Contextual Substitution**: These combinations are handled through contextual alternates rather than static ligature glyphs.
- **OpenType Features**: Lam-Alef lookups previously defined under `'liga'` and `'rlig'` have been removed. The new behavior is implemented via `'rclt'` (Required Contextual Alternates).

Released: 22 September 2025

## Why the Name Change to “Vazirharf”?

The name change helps avoid confusion with the original font, which is widely distributed via package managers but will no longer receive updates.

**Vazirharf** reflects both continuity and evolution:

- **“Vazir”**: Preserves the legacy of the original font.
- **“Harf” (حرف)**: Arabic for “letter,” reflecting the shift from single-glyph ligatures to letter-wise composition.

## Who Should Use Vazirharf?

Use **Vazirharf**:
- If you are in a situation where you need to disable ligatures (because you want feedback for each character you type), but you still want the original visual appearance of Lam-Alef ligatures.
Common scenarios where this might happen is on typing platforms that do not use an input box e.g, [monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com).
- If you require ongoing updates and support.
